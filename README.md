The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` contains the project based on the WorldCupMatches dataset contains ~4500 world cup matches from 1930 to 2014. Each row represents an individual match and the columns are the corresponding attributes. For this project, we are going to perform analysis on this dataset focusing primarily on the behaviors of individual countries.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the dataset Florida_Lakes, utilizing the powerful plotting functions in ggplot I was able to create interesting plots on lakes that are in Florida. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

**Sample data visualization:**

### Moving Forward

This is only the start of my journey for learning about the different techniques in data visualization. In the future I will explore with more dataset and improve on my skills on data story telling.
